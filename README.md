# 📊 Job Classification & Insights

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify different types of jobs based on textual data such as job titles and descriptions.  
By analyzing important features and patterns, the project aims to better understand how text information can help automatically categorize jobs, supporting HR analytics and job recommendation systems.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Preprocess and explore text data related to jobs.
- Transform text features into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes).
- Identify key features influencing classification performance.
- Visualize results and provide insights for practical applications.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**  
- **pandas**, **NumPy** for data processing  
- **scikit-learn** for text vectorization, modeling, and evaluation  
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn** for visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development and documentation

## ✨ Key Insights
- Certain words or patterns in job titles and descriptions are strong indicators for specific job categories.
- Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes performed differently based on feature selection and vectorization.
- Feature importance analysis helps identify which terms most strongly influence classification.
- Imbalanced data impacts model performance, requiring careful feature selection or sampling strategies.

## ✅ Conclusion
Machine learning can effectively classify job postings based on text data, supporting automation in HR systems and job platforms.  
Further improvement could include using advanced NLP techniques like word embeddings or transformer-based models.
